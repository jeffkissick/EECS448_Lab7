Bugs List:

1. isEmpty() returns true for any list. Even if there is an item in the list.
   My test for this is called testIsNotEmpty().

2. addBack() doesn't function as it should.  Instead of adding to the back of the list,
   this simply adds to the front of the list.  I tested this for both a single and multiple  
   values.  My tests for this are called testAddBackSingle() and testAddBackMultiple().

3. removeFront() doesn't function as it should in many ways.  Firstly, it doesn't remove    
   anything.  Secondly, it doesn't return true when it should remove an item from the list.  
   As it doesn't remove anything I assume this behavior makes sense.
   My tests for these are called testRemoveFrontSingle(), testRemoveFrontMultiple(), 
   testRemoveFrontReturnsTrueWithNonEmptyList().

4. removeBack() also doesn't function as it should in many ways.  In fact, its identical to 
   removeFront() in that it doesn't work at all.  It removes nothing and thus returns false 
   always.  My tests for these are called testRemoveBackSingle(), testRemoveBackMultiple(), 
   and testRemoveBackReturnsTrueWithNonEmptyList().

5. The destructor doesn't destruct the linked list.  This one I'm not positive about as I 
   didn't think the way I was going about it would work but a geek for geeks page aparently 
   tells me I can go about it the way I did.  My test for this is testDestructor().
